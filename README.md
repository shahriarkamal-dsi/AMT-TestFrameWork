# Automation Test Framework
 
This is a keyword and data driven Testing Framework with cross browsing testing facility. The plan is writing  test steps with keyword and data in excel file. Every step has a action field, which is basically a class.method format, and it will be invoked with provided keyword and test data. Every excel file has a Execution-Flag field, if it is not 'yes' the corresponding  excel row is not considered for execution. There is a default property file, in where browser name can be provided. There are multiple excel files and sheets for test plan, modules, test suits, test cases and test steps.  
 
## Getting Started

### 1.ModuleController.xlsx (Test plan) :

If Execution flag is any other value except yes, the module  will not be executed else executed. 


### 2.Module( Test suite, Test case, Test step) : 
module is a composite of multiple test suites. And test suites is actually a different tab in excel file. In test suite multiple test cases can be kept.

Here a test case is illustrated  located in  test suite(tab). Here  action is method name with class which need to be invoked. Test data keeps  data, and object-locators has  keyword reference. Format is “ExcelFileName.TabName.KeywordName.” 
Example : 
Common.Login.txtUserName. 
There is a keyword in common.xlsx in Login tab named txtUserName.
